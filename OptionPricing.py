# Summary: We can see that the price of option at time t computed from above three methods are close, which means our solutions make sense. The real value of option at time t is some number close to 4.92. We can also increase the accuracy of our Monte Carlo and PDE method by doing more simulation and adding more grid points respectively. But that will be a trade off between accuracy and time complexity.
